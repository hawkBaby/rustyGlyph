# rustyGlyph
Simple Anaglyph 3D generator built in rust. Current WIP

## What is this? 

Last week I dug up a pair of red/blue anaglyph glasses from my sock draw and thought it may be a fun exercise to build a anaglyph generator. 

## Why?

Boredom and I wanted to improve my Rust Skills. 

## Can I get involved? 

Do what you want. This project has an MIT licence.
