# rustyGlyph
Simple Anaglyph 3D generator built in rust. Current WIP

## What is this? 

Last week I dug up a pair of red/blue anaglyph glasses from my sock draw and thought it may be a fun exercise to build a anaglyph generator. 

## Why?

Boredom and I wanted to improve my Rust Skills. 

## How do I run this? 

Install the latest rust compiler and then run the following command in the root folder `cargo run --release`

## Can I get involved? 

Do what you want. This project has an MIT licence. 

## Current State
* Safe multithreaded pixel generation
* Manual Image loading
* Manual Image Output
* Uses optimized image loading

## TODO
* Error handling for missing images
* Date stamp inclusion on output
* Configs for Input/output image types
* Proper unit testing
* dynamic import types
